Final reflection on meetups:

The meetup at Splat Space was mostly dedicated to talking with my classmates about the plans for our final project, which was useful although it could have been done outside of a coding meetup. There was also some discussion from other people there on unusual applications of Python which I had not been aware of, and one person present gave us an assessment of our general idea, deeming it ambitious but possible.

I found the two meetups of TriPython to be more helpful, though, as they involved hands-on learning on my part. Chris Calloway was very helpful in explaining Python functions to me. At the most recent meetup, was pleasantly surprised that I was eventually able to concentrate and improve my understanding of our teamâ€™s project in the noisy environment of a bar. I acquired his contact information and he has encouraged me to contact him in the future for coding-related assistance. As I will be remaining in Chapel Hill for most of the summer, I hope to attend more meetings of the TriPython group.

Incidentally, I learned while walking back to my car from the last meeting that Chris had some experience with OCR as well. This was part of the subject of my recently completed final paper for Information Retrieval, and I found the topic particularly interesting.
